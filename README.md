üìö Overview
In this repository, I‚Äôll document my journey in SQL, demonstrating my growing skills through code, notes, and milestone projects. The focus is on practical applications of SQL concepts that I can directly use in real-world scenarios, especially in data analysis and database management.

Book Reference: Learn SQL: A Practical Approach
Goal: Transition to a data-centric career in database management, data analysis, or data science.

üéØ Learning Goals
Master SQL basics and advance through to complex queries and database management.
Apply SQL skills in milestone projects that solve realistic data problems.
Build an organized, trackable record of SQL skills for my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
